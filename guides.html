        <h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
        <p class="intro">At Qover, we build insurance products that enable commerce at a business scale. Our mission is to make insurance
          better for everyone, no matter their level of experience.</p>
        <p>We create websites that give even the most inexperienced company the best chance to succeed.</p>
        <h3>Our approach</h3>
        <p>Our principles are at the heart of how we approach product design and development. They’re important whether you
          work at Qover or you’re developing third-party apps or themes.</p>
        <h4>Put Merchants First</h4>
        <p>Think about the needs of different types of merchants and be intentional about how to respond to them in a product
          or feature. Whenever possible, use research to inform your decision-making so you can map your process to how real
          merchants think and work.</p>
        <h4>Empower but don't Overwhelm</h4>
        <p>Qover builds powerful tools that simplify how merchants run their businesses. Even though the systems we design are
          complicated, they should feel effortless. We accomplish this by removing unnecessary steps and making sure people
          understand what they need to do throughout the experience.</p>
        <h2 id="internationalization">Internationalization</h2>
        <img width="80%" src="img/guides/map-qover.png" />
        <p class="intro">Make insurance better for everyone by building interfaces that work everywhere. These guidelines will help you design,
          write, and build products that can be used in, and adapted for, every part of the world.</p>
        <p>We want our business clients to experience Qover in a way that’s appropriate and meaningful to them, no matter where
          they are in Europe.</p>
        <p>As far as possible, we aim to build one experience that works for all our clients. However, there are times when
          that one experience won’t work for a specific locale or culture. When this happens, it’s best to tailor the experience
          for the merchants in that locale.</p>
        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <h4>Internationalization</h4>
        <p>Building your product and interface so they can be used in different locales. This includes creating flexible interfaces
          that allow for text expansion and changes to word order.</p>
        <h4>Localization</h4>
        <p>Adapting your product and interface for different locales to make them a good cultural fit. This includes adapting
          features, changing visuals, and translating text.</p>
        <h4>Translation</h4>
        <p>Converting text from one language to another. Not to be confused with localization, translation is just one part
          of localizing a product.</p>
        <h4>Locale</h4>
        <p>A linguistic region defined by both its language and country. Examples: French-France (fr-FR); French-Canada (fr-CA);
          Portuguese-Brazil (pt-BR)..</p>
        <h3>Plan for text expansion</h3>
        <p>When interfaces are localized, the content will often expand in length. In most languages, text is up to 50% longer
          on average than English. Your interface needs to be flexible enough to accommodate these kinds of text expansion.</p>
        <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
        <p class="intro">Making insurance better for everyone means caring deeply about making quality products. A quality product should
          have a fantastic user experience (UX), including:
          <ul>
            <li>A beautiful and functional design</li>
            <li>Consistent and useful copy</li>
            <li>Principles of universal design and inclusivity</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Usable for everyone</h3>
        <p>It’s important that Qover products — and Partner products — are usable and useful to everyone.</p>
        <p>“Everyone” is a pretty big group. It includes our partners, their customers, our developer partners, our employees,
          and the greater tech community at large.</p>
        <p>“Everyone” also includes:
          <ul>
            <li>There are estimated to be over 30 million blind and partially sighted persons in geographical Europe.</li>
            <li>An average of 1 in 30 Europeans experience sight loss.</li>
            <li>There are four times as many partially sighted persons as blind persons.</li>
            <li>Women are more at risk of becoming blind or partially sighted than men.</li>
            <li>Sight loss is closely related to old age.</li>
            <li>One in three senior citizens over 65 faces sight loss. 90 percent of visually impaired persons is over the age
              of 65. [Source: http://www.euroblind.org/about-blindness-and-partial-sight/facts-and-figures]</li>
            <li>16% of adult Europeans suffer from hearing loss great enough to adversely affect their daily life.</li>
            <li>71 million adults aged 18 to 80 years have a hearing impairment. [Source: https://www.hear-it.org/hearing-loss-in-europe]</li>
            <li>24.3 % of the population aged 16 and over reported (some or severe) long-standing limitations in their usual
              activities due to health problems [Source: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Functional_and_activity_limitations_statistics]</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Building inclusive experiences</h3>
        <p>Using our re-usable components is a way to improve accessibility and consistency when building products for Qover.
          <ul>
            <li>The component library in this styleguide includes component code we can use across websites</li>
            <li>This component code includes accessible markup</li>
            <li>Since the code exists in a single component that gets reused, it’s easier to update and fix any bugs</li>
          </ul>
          The build-it-once, use-it-everywhere model means the accessibility knowledge of the developers who build these components
          is now available to all of Qover and our Partners. This way our users get a consistent, accessible experience,
          each and every time.
        </p>
        <h4>Alternative Text</h4>
        <p>Our components use alternative text for icons, complex images, and actions (like buttons and links) to help people
          with low or loss of vision use our products.</p>
        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>Sometimes building accessible and inclusive experiences can be hard. If we’ve made any mistakes in this style guide,
          please reach out by creating a GitHub issue and help us make it better!</p>
        <h4>Contrast</h4>
        <p>Contrasts between a text and its background must always be higher than:
          <ul>
            <li>4.5:1 for small text, content, etc.</li>
            <li>3:1 for titles and big fonts</li>
          </ul>
